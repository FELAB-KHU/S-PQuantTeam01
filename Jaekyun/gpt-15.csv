This theoretical fund balances growth potential and defensive plays to aim for an overall outperformance of the S&P 500.

"To create a theoretical fund that aims to outperform the S&P 500 index, we can draw from various investing strategies employed by successful funds and investors. Here's a hypothetical blend of growth, value, and momentum investing with an overlay of sector diversification to mitigate risk.

4. **Sector Diversification** - Ensuring the fund isn't overly exposed to a single sector, which diminishes sector-specific risk.
